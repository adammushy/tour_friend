                '''Ruaha National Park is the largest national park in Tanzania making it the largest park in East Africa. The name of the park is derived from the Great Ruaha River, which flows along its southeastern margin and is the focus for game viewing.
             The park can be reached by private plane and there are 2 airstrips â€“ Msembe airstrip at Msembe (National Park Headquarters), and Jongomeru Airstrip.
